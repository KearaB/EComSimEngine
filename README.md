# E-Commerce Transaction Data Simulation

This project simulates transaction data for an e-commerce website. The primary objective is to generate a realistic dataset that can be used for practicing data modeling and analysis. The data includes user details, transaction specifics, merchant information, and product details.

**ðŸ“¢Note: This project is currently in progress. Data modeling and analysis scripts are forthcoming.**

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:
* **Data Generation**: A Python script that generates fake data.
* **Data Modeling**: (Planned) Scripts for setting up database schemas to model the generated data.
* **Data Analysis**: (Planned) Analysis scripts to derive insights from the data.

## Data Generation
### Overview
The data generation script creates a CSV file containing 100,000 rows of transaction data. Each row represents a transaction and includes details about the user, the merchant, the transaction itself, and the product being transacted.
